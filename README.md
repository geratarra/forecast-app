# forecast-app

Well, I wanted to learn React Native to create mobile apps and I started to read a book and a few tutorials.
This is a weather forecast app used as an introduction in the book "*Learn React Native. Building mobile apps
with Javascript.*" by Bonnie Eisenman. I hope to have time to keep learning and improve the app, obviously it is super simple and it contains the minimum features to work.

### Things to consider..
* The author developes the app for iOS system, fortunately, there was no need to make substantial changes to make the app works thanks to the React flexibility.

* You have to write the name of a city to make the weather request (insted of a zip code as mentioned in the book). For that reason, I had to make a little change in the user interface.

* I use the "*openweathermap*" API in order to make the weather requests.
